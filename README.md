Hello, everyone. 

Here is the solution of the assignment with 5 exercises. 

I have tried to complete the given tasks as instructed in the problem statement. 

Deployment using kubeflow or Seldon-core and creating ML pipeline with ZenML is something which is very new to me and I have tried doing it,
but I was getting some errors with setting up tools in my local machine. Hence, those tasks are not completed yet and I'm trying to learn it. 
I will be able to do it in due course of time tough. 

Kindly open different exercise folders and you will find jupyter notebook for each of the exercise. For exercise 5, I have created main.py file. 
In each Jupyter notebook, I have completed exercise in step by step manner by clear description above each cell. 

I would be happy to talk about everything in a call, if required. 

Thanks a lot!
